If you don’t have the cash or credit to cover a financial emergency, you might be thinking about getting a payday loan. But some payday lenders are not honest about how they collect on those loans and take more payments than they said they would.

The FTC sued Harvest Moon and other online payday lenders for their alleged practices in extending high-fee, short-term “payday” loans. In websites, telemarketing, and loan agreements, the companies told people they would repay a set amount with a fixed number of payments withdrawn from people’s bank accounts. But, instead of doing what they said they would do, these companies kept people on a costly treadmill — repeatedly taking money from their bank accounts, paycheck after paycheck, without ever reducing the amounts they borrowed. As a result, some people wound up paying around $1,200 for, say, $250 loans, says the FTC.
